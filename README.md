Mobile Programming Assignment #4

Create an application which shows a splash screen when starting. The screen shows the name of the application and the logo of the application in the middle of the screen. The splash screen lasts for 3,5 seconds before moving on.

The next screen, which is the main screen of the application, consists of a EditText and a Button. The button enables/disables the EditText.

When the phone orientation changes from vertical to horizontal (or horizontal to vertical) the text inputted in the EditText stays the same. Also the EditText stays enabled or disabled after the orientation change.

After this implement a general solution of your choice to save the state of the views in your activity. Meaning that you are not hardcoding the views when saving the states but instead somehow iterating through all necessary views used for state.
